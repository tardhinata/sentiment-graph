Sentiment graph visualization
======

Project to visualize sentiment between developers in Gerrit project.

Sentiment is polarity of positive, negative, and neutral tone of developers' code review comments in gerrit.
The complete research to calculate this sentiment can be seen in our paper: http://www.inf.unibz.it/~russo/Publications/Code_Review.pdf

Do you want to know how the developers interact each others and how is the relationship between them?

The visualization developed using D3.js (http://d3js.org)

For use case, we analyze the core review of developers in 3 famous Gerrit repositories:
- Ovirt (http://gerrit.ovirt.org)
- Chromium OS (http://gerrit.chromium.org)
- Typo3 (http://review.typo3.org)
